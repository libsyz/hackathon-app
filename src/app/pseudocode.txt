## splash Page ## 

should only kickstart the creation of a hackathon
it will always send the user to the timer on phase one

## The timer-page needs to know which part of the hackathon we are at so
## >it can update dynamic text on the page
## >it can fetch the right tools
## >it can direct the user to the right page once the time is over
## > Either page upload / or problem solving / or testing

## the well-hacked page also needs to know which part of the hackathon 
## we are at, so 

## >it can display data dynamically 
## >it can direct the user to the right page (either a new 
## hackathon page or the review page)


## Conclusion 
## 1. We are not getting anywhere without managing params over here
## 2. All redirection logic should be part of a service or some kind
## of navigation guard, it should not be in the page
## 3. It might be worth exploring how to minimize Db calls
## when going from one place to the other, having an object in memory
## would be optimal
