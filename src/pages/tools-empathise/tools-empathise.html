    <h2> EMPATHISE </h2>
    <h4> WHY? </h4>
    <p>Making sure that our solution to the problem addresses the real needs and 
      requirements of our user group.
    </p>
    <h4>WHAT?</h4>
    <p>Identifying needs, requirements & concerns for different 
      groups of people that will be using/be affected by the solution.
    </p>
    <h4>HOW</h4>
    <p>Defining our user groups, drawing an adoption curve for each of them
      and empathising about the needs, requirements, potential contraints and 
      concerns of early adopters, average users and laggards. 
    </p>

    <h4>KEY QUESTIONS</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Who are your users? Define up to three user/stakeholder groups</li>
      <li>If you put yourself in the shoes of the user, what are their pain points, needs
        motivations, feelings?
