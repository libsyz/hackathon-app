    <h3>WHY</h3>
    <p>Gaining customer feedback as quick as possible in order to decide whether to keep the 
      solution, change it or stop working on it.
    </p>
    <h3> WHAT</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a small experiment of how to test the solution and think
        about hypotheses, measurement of data, test design etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>HOW</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Design a cheap and simple experiment that allows to test the idea 
        as quickly as possible and get feedback
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete the test card (if running out of time, ensure 
        there are at least Next Steps and Owner completed)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How/where/when/who will test the prototype?</strong></p>
